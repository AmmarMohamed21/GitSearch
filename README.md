# GitSearch
Simple Android App built with kotlin that uses [GitHub APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users) to search for users and retrieve them.
## Development
The application applies MVVM architecture.
The applied features are searching for users, loading more results through pagination by scrolling to the end and navigate to the user profile by clicking on it.
This application was built as a part of learning phase for an internship with _VOIS.
